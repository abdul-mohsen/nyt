# nyt

to build the app you need to add this line in gradle.locale
APIKey = "XSaGklVBZVeMhL9oVk7fFVbFAYU01TeV"


to build the app use 
./gradlew assembleDebug

then install it using
adb install /app/build/output/PATH_TO_APK

side note the feature/mostPopular is left to show git history to show progress [As I did not use a template]
but real work was squash since the api key was hardcoded in one of the commits
